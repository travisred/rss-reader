I want to create an RSS reader/client in the style of Google Reader. See google-reader-page.png for an example of how the UI looks.

1. I want it to be build with Laravel, Vue.js, Tailwind CSS, and MySQL
2. I want it to have user registration and log in
3. I want it users to be able to add RSS feed URLs to their account
4. I want it to be able to fetch new items for an RSS feed
5. I want it to be containerized and use Docker
